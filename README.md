# Dog Party

This is the first project I completed during the front end program at the Turing School of Software and Design. The point of the project was to build a 1-page static site to practice writing well structured, semantic HTML with clean, precise CSS, as well as adding some user interaction with Javascript and the DOM.

## Key Features

* **Responsive** - The content looks good on any screen size
* **Mobile Menu** - I implemented a mobile menu using Javascript that shows or hides when the user clicks the menu icon.

## Built With

* [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5)
* [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
* [JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
